We should install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/) in Jenkins instance or you may setup the Jenkins by following the instructions in [Jenkins Setup](https://github.com/erpushpinderrana/jenkins-terraform-aws/tree/master/jenkins_scripts) repository.
* Install the required plugins such as Docker Pipeline, Amazon ECR and CloudBees AWS Credentials Plugins.
* Configure your aws credentials in jenkins account using `aws configure` command.
