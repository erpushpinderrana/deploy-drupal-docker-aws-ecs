# Deploy Drupal Website Docker Containers on AWS ECS
WIP

## Next Steps:
* Fix the manual configurations issues in `aws-ecs-immutable` branch to setup the ECS infra initially.
* Fix the manual configurations issues in `aws-jenkins-ecs-deployment` branch to setup the deployment using Jenkins.
* After fixing both the above branches, combine the logic of both `aws-ecs-immutable` and `aws-jenkins-ecs-deployment` in the master branch.
